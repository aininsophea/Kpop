<h3>the Fandom Name</h3>
<p>Like other K-pop groups, EXO created the fandom name "EXO-L" for their fans. The "L" stands for Love to express the groups care and love towards their fans.</p>
</div> 

<div class="fan">
<h3>the Chants</h3>
<p>Whether an EXO-L is watching EXO perform live or through a laptop screen, they certainly will cheer for their favourite Kpop group through memorising the chants! </p>

<h3>the Merchandise</h3>

<h3>EXO's Schedule</h3>
<p>To keep yoursef updated with EXO, other than following the members' social media accounts, an avid EXO-L has created a Google Calendar for EXO-Ls to know when their idols are performing!</p>

<h2>Dresscode</h2>	
	
<div class="fan">
<p>There is no consistent dress code for EXO-Ls but it is always fun to dress up according to EXO's theme colour, which is light grey. Occasionally, during concerts or cafe events, EXO-L fanbases would encourage fans to dress up based on a theme and this will determine whether you would get freebies. So, if you want the freebies, do dress up!</p>

  <p>A fan of a k-pop group experiences many joys, from supporting their artists by buying albums to watching them on stage. There many ways to support your favourite K-pop group and the community of fandoms are always willing to help newbies of this hobby. As a fangirl myself, K-pop has allowed me to find comfort in music and the members of EXO have been great role models. They have shown how they are exemplary people by spreading positivity to the world.</p>
